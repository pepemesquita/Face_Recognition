#Face Recognition in Python
This project is an implementation of facial recognition in Python for the PinguimBots robotics group. It uses the OpenCV library to capture camera images and perform real-time face recognition.

#Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. In addition, you need to install the OpenCV library using the pip package manager. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python
You also need to install the NumPy library, which is used for array operations in the program. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install numpy

#Usage
To run the project, simply clone this repository and run the FaceRecognition.py file. Make sure you have a camera connected to your computer so that the program can capture images.

Open the bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/Face_Recognition.git
cd repository-name
python FaceRecognition.py
We hope that this project is helpful to you and your team in developing robots and facial recognition systems. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
